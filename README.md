======================
This repo contains an R script "run_analysis.R" and corresponding code book for creation of a tidy dataset summarizing a larger dataset of human movement collected by monitoring smartphone accelerometers.  The records in the full dataset are partitioned into test and training subsets which are merged back into a single datset for the purpose of this analysis. There are 6  activity states:

LAYING
SITTING
STANDING
WALKING
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
